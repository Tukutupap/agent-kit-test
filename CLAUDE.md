# CLAUDE.md

A throwaway project for testing the agent kit end to end.

## Start here

@AGENTS.md

Read `knowledge/index.md` at the start of work. `knowledge/` is the only home for project knowledge, and updating it is part of every change, as `AGENTS.md` section 2 says. Don't put project knowledge in auto memory or private notes. Keep those for what's personal or specific to one machine.

## Technology direction

<!-- Product: the stack, where it runs, and the decisions an agent should not reopen, each with its ADR. -->

## Non-negotiables

<!-- Product: the rules that must never break, one per line. Keep them in step with AGENTS.md section 5. -->

- All mocks and gaps must be documented.

## Agent behavior

Do not stop for non-blocking ambiguity. Make secure assumptions, implement them, and record each one as a new file in `knowledge/decisions/asm`. If an external provider requires credentials, build the adapter, mock implementation, configuration contract, and documented setup path.
