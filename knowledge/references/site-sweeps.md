# Site sweeps

The site-sweep skill reads this page. It holds the method; this page holds what's specific to Agent Kit Test: which sweeps exist, what each one checks, where to run them, and how to sign in. Keep secrets out of it.

Reports are written to `knowledge/sweeps/`, named by the UTC time they finished and the sweep, such as `2026-11-06-1530-api.md`.

## Sweeps

<!-- Product: one `###` section per sweep, such as API, App, Platform and Product. For each, say what to test, in what order, and the questions to ask. The examples below are a starting point; rewrite them for this product. -->

### API

Test every route, staff routes included: money first, then status changes, then the rest, on a local copy.

| Check | Question |
| --- | --- |
| Access | Are role and ownership enforced on the server? Does someone else's record return 404? |
| Repeats | Does a request sent twice, or five at once, change or charge anything twice? |
| Order | Is it refused when the record is in the wrong status? |
| Input | Are dates, amounts, IDs and text limits checked? |
| Failure | If a provider fails midway, can it be retried, with the record left correct? |
| Exposure | Is everything the caller shouldn't see left out? |
| Audit | Are sensitive actions recorded? |

### App

Use the app where it's deployed for testing, at desktop and phone width, as each kind of user. Run each workflow once from start to finish and try to break it: go back, refresh, double-click, use two tabs, enter unusual input, and act as someone who isn't allowed.

### Platform

Hosting, deploys and rollback, backups, health checks, alerts, rate limits, security headers, database constraints and slow queries, background jobs, dependencies and secrets.

### Product

Compare with competitors from their own pages, citing only pages you opened.

## Knowledge each sweep reviews

<!-- Which knowledge/ pages each sweep compares with what it saw, such as features and gaps for API, environment and runbooks for Platform. -->

## Where to run, and signing in

<!-- Where each sweep runs (local copy, a shared test environment), and where test logins live. Name a git-ignored file for credentials; never put them here. -->
