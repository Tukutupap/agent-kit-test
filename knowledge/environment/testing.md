# Testing

<!-- Product: written once by the agent kit, then owned by this project. Describe each suite, what it needs, and which checks are required on main. -->

## Locally

`npx --yes github:Tukutupap/agent-kit#v1 knowledge-check` runs the full suite. Run it before opening a pull request ready for review.

## On GitHub

- **Knowledge structure** checks `knowledge/` on pull requests that change it, and after every merge to `main`.
- **Pull request format** checks the title and description of every pull request.
<!-- Add this product's own CI checks, and say which are required on main. -->
